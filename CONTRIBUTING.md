# Contributing

If one wishes to contribute to the project, they should keep in mind that it is a research/experiment project, and, therefore, all the new features have to be discussed.
However, I am ready to review all new suggestions.
In order to suggest a feature one can open an issue and explain their idea.

Also, I should note that I am not that experienced in Rust, so the code and structure of the project may be stinky.
If you think that some piece of code can be improved (both from "local" and "global" points) then leave an issue describing the improvement.
All of them will be welcome :)
